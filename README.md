### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!-- Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development. I'm save in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass. 
I did a lot tutorials in JavaScript, as there are freecodecamp.org, frontend Mentor, 30 days of JavaScript, Code Wars, etc. 
In JavaScript I know *all* the basics. Currently I work a lot with third party APIs and Ajax to learn them well. 
Here are projects I'm proud of:
- SBF Trainer
- Star Wars Cards
- advice generator
